# COTD Buffer Time clone

This is a clone of [COTD Delta time](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/cotddeltako).
COTD Buffer Time was written because COTD Delta time started crashing my game on the first CP (some of the time) ([github issue for PlayerState](https://github.com/thommie-echo/TMNext-PlayerState/issues/11)).

*This plugin depends on __MLHook__ v0.3.0+ and __MLFeed: Race Data__. You must also install those plugins.*

The aim of this plugin is to do basically the same thing as COTD Delta time.

Also the font is monospaced for a nicer visual experience.

todo:
- wizard
  - fonts
  - COTD/KO settings
  - TA/Campaign settings
